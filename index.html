                <p>When a 3-hour-long film doesn't SEEM like it lasts for 3 hours, that is an achievement in and of itself.  Few movies this lengthy are this entertaining.  The Godfather is one classic example.  (Actually that film is slightly less than 3 hours but still.) I can watch such a film over and over again and not get tired of it.  Or I can watch PARTS and never tire of THEM.  There are so many things to LIKE about THIS  film that the few criticisms I have are forgiveable.  I cannot talk about them here without spoiling anything for someone who hasn't yet seen ENDGAME or its predecessors in the MCU, so I won't elaborate.  What I will say is that of the 23 movies in the saga this is DEFINITELY among my top five favorites.  Marvel has managed to invest such personality into so many of its MCU characters that even those I don't particularly care for in the source comic book material come alive here, with few exceptions.</p>

                <p>Disney’s, live-action, LION KING, is amazing and wonderful in many ways in its: live-action characters, cinematography, music, comic relief, themes and more. It has the theme of challenging deception and disinformation that reveals truth and sets characters free. Other worthwhile themes concern the value of family, friends, home, courage, sacrificial love and more.</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
